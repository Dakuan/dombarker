Hi! I'm a capable technology leader who is equally happy dealing with people or computers. I build high performing teams and give smart people the environment they need to do their best work. I am an effective communicator and am comfortable with internal, customer, board or investor interactions. I specialise in early stage startups and have a wealth of experience of rapid development under pressure and managing the trade offs that come with it.

I'm currently working on a secret squirrel stealth mode startup that's going to help more people own their own home.

I live in Hitchin, Hertfordshire where I spend my time falling off bicycles, walking my dog or taking [photos](https://photos.dombarker.co.uk). If you'd like to get in touch feel free to [email me](mailto:dom@dombarker.co.uk).
